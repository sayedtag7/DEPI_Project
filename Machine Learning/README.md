Key Features

    Data Preprocessing:
        Cleans and prepares the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, handling duplicates, and managing missing values.

    Correlation Analysis:
        Visualizes relationships between different features and the target variable using a correlation heatmap.

    Model Selection:
        Implements Support Vector Regression (SVR) with an RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel for regression tasks.

    Feature Scaling:
        Standardizes features to enhance the performance of the SVR model.

    Performance Evaluation:
        Evaluates the model's performance using R-squared scores and visualizes actual vs. predicted values with scatter plots.

    Visualization:
        Provides graphical representations of results to easily interpret the model's predictions compared to actual data.
