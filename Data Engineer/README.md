# Data Engineering

## Technologies Used:

- **Microsoft Azure Data Lake** for storing unstructured data from all factory systems.
- **Azure Synapse Analytics (Data Warehouse)** to organize and analyze structured data from different sources.
- **Azure Data Factory** to automate ETL processes, transferring data from the Data Lake to the Data Warehouse.
- **Microsoft SQL Server** for managing structured data related to product quality and equipment performance.

## Innovation and Uniqueness:

- **Integrated Analysis**: Using a Data Lake to capture all raw data and a Data Warehouse to present a comprehensive view of production quality.

## Expected Outcomes:

- **Enhanced Operational Efficiency**: Improving manufacturing processes and minimizing production downtime, leading to higher competitiveness for the plant.
- **Increased Equipment Efficiency**: Continuous monitoring of equipment performance to ensure optimal operation and reduced downtime.
